# Business Recommendations/Insights

1. **US & UK Focus**: These are Netflix's top markets, with the most content. Emerging markets like India (movies) and Japan & Korea (TV shows) also present growth opportunities.

2. **Recent Content**: Though Netflix started in 1997, most content is post-2015. A strategy of regularly replacing old content with new releases keeps viewers engaged.

3. **Regional Talent**: Promoting Indian actors in movies and Japanese, Korean, and Chinese actors in TV shows aligns with regional preferences.

4. **Genre Trends**: International, Comedy, and Drama dominate both movies and TV shows. Underproduced genres like 'Cult' aren't recommended for growth.

5. **American Content**: US content leads Netflix, especially in International, Comedy, Drama, Action, and Documentaries. UK follows, with India rising in International Drama and Comedy, and Japan/Korea excel in romantic TV shows.

6. **Fresh Content Priority**: While niche audiences might enjoy old classics, focusing on new releases is essential for growth.

7. **Ratings Insight**: TV MA-rated content, especially International movies, TV shows, and Dramas, aligns with viewership trends.

8. **Content Duration**: Most successful movies run between 1:30 and 1:40. TV shows often end after one season, so extending beyond that requires strong content, actors, and direction, especially for International Drama, Thriller, and Comedy genres.
